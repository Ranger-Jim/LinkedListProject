Creating a program to be used for video rentals. To start program, run java VideoStore <data structure>.  The data structures implemented at this point are SLL (singly linked list), DLL (doubly linked list), or BST (binary search tree). So to run the program using a singly list, run java VideoStore SLL. If you want to get performance times for each data structure, run java VideoStore <data structure> <amount of videos to initialize> <amount of customers to initialize> <amount of processes to perform>.  So for example, java VideoStore SLL 300 20 100.  The performance will automatically write to a file called Performance.docx.
